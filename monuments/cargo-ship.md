## Overview

The Cargo Ship (CCSC Lazarus) is one of Rust's most unique monuments. Unlike other static monuments, this massive cargo vessel is mobile and only spawns periodically. The ship announces its arrival with a loud horn that can be heard across the map. When it appears, it circles the map for about 40-45 minutes before leaving the area.

## For New Players

If you're new to Rust, here's what you should know about the Cargo Ship:

- This is a **high-tier monument** with excellent loot but significant difficulty
- The ship is mobile and spawns every few hours
- Listen for the ship's horn to know when it spawns
- There is no radiation while the ship is circling the map
- Heavy radiation appears when the ship leaves
- Heavy scientist presence makes solo runs extremely challenging
- Water transportation is required to reach the monument
- This monument is best approached with a group until you're very experienced

## Requirements

To fully explore the Cargo Ship, you will need:

- **Weapons**: High-tier weapons (AK-47, LR-300, or better)
- **Medical supplies**: 5-10 medical syringes and bandages
- **Water transportation**: Boat, RHIB, or helicopter
- **Laptop**: Required for hacking crates
- **Group members**: Highly recommended for new players
- **Radiation protection**: Only needed after the ship leaves

## Crate Mechanics

The Cargo Ship's locked crates are a key feature:

- **Crate Locations**: 2-3 locked crates spawn on the ship
- **Hacking Process**:
  - Requires a laptop to initiate hack
  - Takes 15 minutes to complete
  - Progress is shown on a timer
  - Cannot be interrupted or the timer resets
- **Loot Tables**:
  - Military grade weapons
  - High-tier armor
  - Explosives and ammunition
  - Valuable components
  - Rare items

## Ship Timeline

Understanding the timing is crucial:

1. **Spawn**: Ship appears with loud horn signal
2. **Active Period**: 40-45 minutes of sailing
3. **Warning**: Ship horn signals departure
4. **Departure Phase**:
   - Heavy radiation begins
   - 2-minute survival period
   - Crates respawn after radiation
   - Ship disappears from map

## Radiation Mechanics

The Cargo Ship has unique radiation mechanics:

- **While Ship is Active**: No radiation on the ship
- **After Ship Leaves**: 
  - Radiation quickly increases
  - Can be deadly if not prepared
  - Lasts for 2 minutes
  - After 2 minutes, the ship respawns all locked crates and radiation stops
  - Ship appears to disappear off the map

4. **Multiple Hacks**: Run multiple crates simultaneously

## Tips & Tricks for New Players

- **Sound Awareness**: Listen for footsteps and gunfire

## Alternative Entry Methods

Besides the main entrance, consider:

2. **Side Climbing**: Using terrain elevation
3. **RHIB Approach**: Fast and maneuverable
4. **Multiple Entry Points**: Split team entry

The Cargo Ship represents one of Rust's most unique and challenging monuments. While extremely dangerous, mastering it will make you a much more capable player. Start with group runs and gradually work up to more advanced strategies as you gain experience.
