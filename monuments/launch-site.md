## Overview

The Launch Site is one of the most high-tier monuments in Rust, offering exceptional loot but also significant danger. For new players, this monument can be intimidating but extremely rewarding. The monument features a large rocket, a main building complex, and several auxiliary structures. The area has high radiation levels, especially near the rocket, requiring proper protection.

## For New Players

If you're new to Rust, here's what you should know about the Launch Site:

- This is considered an **end-game monument** with the best loot but highest risk
- Expect to encounter experienced players here frequently
- Consider visiting during off-peak hours when the server has fewer players
- Use this monument to learn about high-tier gameplay, but don't get discouraged if you die frequently

## Requirements

To successfully loot the Launch Site, you will need:

- **Radiation protection**: A Hazmat suit (30% radiation protection) is the minimum requirement. For areas near the rocket, you may need additional protection like anti-radiation pills
- **Red keycard**: Required for accessing the main building's elite crate room
- **Blue keycard**: Needed for the red card puzzle sequence
- **Green keycard**: Required to start the puzzle sequence
- **Fuses**: At least 2-3 fuses (they can break during use)
- **Weapons**: At minimum, a semi-automatic rifle or comparable weapon
- **Medical supplies**: At least 3-5 medical syringes and bandages
- **Food and water**: For extended looting sessions

## Radiation Zones

As a new player, understanding radiation is crucial at the Launch Site:

- **Low radiation**: Outer perimeter and warehouses (0-5 rads)
- **Medium radiation**: Main building and surrounding areas (5-15 rads)
- **High radiation**: Rocket area and certain interior sections (15+ rads)

Without protection, you'll take damage rapidly in medium and high radiation zones. Your radiation level appears as a yellow indicator on your HUD.

## Monument Layout

The Launch Site consists of several key areas:

1. **Main Building Complex**: Multi-story structure with the card puzzle and elite loot
2. **Rocket Area**: High radiation zone with good loot but dangerous exposure
3. **Warehouses**: Multiple storage buildings with moderate loot and minimal radiation
4. **Bradley Patrol Zone**: Central area where the Bradley APC patrols
5. **External Compounds**: Smaller buildings around the perimeter with basic loot

For new players, the warehouses are the safest starting point to learn the monument.

## Puzzle Solution (Detailed Steps)

For beginners, here's a step-by-step guide to completing the card puzzle:

1. **Locate the Green Card Room**: Enter the main building through the ground floor entrance and find the green keycard door (typically on the south side)
2. **Access Green Room**: Use your green keycard on the reader next to the door, then quickly enter before it closes
3. **Find the Timer and Fusebox**: Inside the green room, locate the fusebox on the wall
4. **Insert Fuse**: Place a fuse in the fusebox and press the button to activate the power
5. **Locate Blue Card Room**: Find the staircase to the second floor and locate the blue card door
6. **Access Blue Room**: Use your blue keycard to enter (you have limited time before the power runs out)
7. **Find the Second Fusebox**: Inside the blue room, locate another fusebox and insert a fuse
8. **Locate Red Card Room**: Go to the top floor of the building to find the red card door
9. **Access Elite Crate Room**: Use your red keycard to enter the final room containing elite crates

The entire puzzle should be completed within 3-4 minutes before fuses expire.

## Loot Locations (Detailed)

For new players looking to maximize their loot runs:

### Main Building
- **Ground Floor**: Military crates in maintenance rooms (medium-tier loot)
- **Second Floor**: Scientist offices with regular crates (medium-tier loot)
- **Top Floor**: Elite crate room (high-tier loot, requires red keycard)
- **Roof Access**: Military crate sometimes spawns on the roof

### Rocket Area
- **Base of Rocket**: Multiple military crates (high radiation warning!)
- **Scaffolding**: Tool crates and occasional military crates

### Warehouses
- **Northern Warehouse**: 2-3 regular crates, good for components
- **Eastern Warehouses**: Multiple regular and occasional military crates
- **Southern Storage**: Good for barrels and basic resources

### Bradley APC Loot
- When destroyed, the Bradley drops 3-4 crates with high-tier weapons, armor and components
- **Warning**: Destroying Bradley requires launcher weapons and attracts significant attention

## Scientists and NPCs

The Launch Site is patrolled by hostile NPCs:

- **Regular Scientists**: Found throughout the monument, armed with pistols and rifles
- **Heavy Scientists**: Sometimes spawn near the elite crate room, heavily armored with better weapons
- **Bradley APC**: An armored vehicle that patrols the central area, equipped with a cannon and machine gun

For new players, scientists can be avoided by crouching and moving slowly around corners.

## Dangers and Threats

Beyond radiation, be aware of:

1. **Other Players**: The Launch Site is highly contested by experienced players
2. **Bradley APC**: Will fire upon players who get too close
3. **Fall Damage**: The main building has many high platforms and ledges
4. **Campers**: Players often hide near the elite crate room or building exits
5. **Counter Raiders**: When Bradley is destroyed, expect players to converge on the area

## Tips & Tricks for Beginners

- **Reconnaissance**: Observe the monument from a distance before approaching
- **Sound Discipline**: Use silenced weapons to avoid attracting attention
- **Quick Looting**: Have a planned route and don't linger too long
- **Escape Routes**: Plan multiple paths to leave the monument quickly
- **Time Management**: Dawn/dusk runs offer better visibility for you while making it harder for snipers
- **Bradley Timing**: The Bradley respawns approximately 30 minutes after being destroyed
- **Partner System**: Bring a friend to watch your back while looting
- **Stash Strategy**: Consider hiding a stash with backup gear nearby in case you die

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Underestimating Radiation**: Always check your radiation protection before entering
- **Forgetting Fuses**: Nothing is more frustrating than getting to the puzzle and having no fuses
- **Tunnel Vision**: Don't focus so much on looting that you miss hearing approaching players
- **Overloading**: Know when to leave with your loot rather than getting greedy
- **Poor Planning**: Have all keycards and tools ready before starting the puzzle

Remember that mastering the Launch Site takes practice. Don't be discouraged by initial failures - each run teaches you valuable lessons about one of Rust's most rewarding monuments.
