This will be guarded by our first face-to-face Night vison Scientists. Kill the scientist and continue through the dimly lit corridor to our first open room (Office 1).

- Office 1
Office 1 of Level 0 is guarded by the single Night vison scientist mentioned earlier and should contain 1 crate (brown or millatery).
