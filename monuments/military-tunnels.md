## Overview

The Military Tunnels is a medium-sized underground monument that offers excellent loot opportunities for new and experienced players alike. This network of tunnels carved into a mountain houses military-grade loot guarded by armed scientists. For new players, it presents a good balance of risk and reward compared to larger monuments.

## For New Players

If you're new to Rust, here's what you should know about the Military Tunnels:

- This is a **mid-tier monument** with good loot and moderate difficulty
- The underground layout can be confusing until you learn the paths
- Scientist NPCs pose a significant threat but are predictable
- This monument is excellent for learning PvE combat before facing real players
- The tunnels provide natural protection from roof campers and snipers

## Requirements

To fully explore the Military Tunnels, you will need:

- **Green keycard**: Required for the first door of the puzzle
- **Blue keycard**: Needed for the second stage of the puzzle
- **Fuses**: At least 2-3 fuses (they sometimes break during use)
- **Radiation protection**: Minimal protection (15-20%) is sufficient for most areas
- **Weapons**: At minimum, a revolver or semi-automatic pistol, but a semi-automatic rifle is recommended
- **Medical supplies**: 3-5 medical syringes or bandages
- **Flashlight or weapon flashlight attachment**: The tunnels can be very dark

## Radiation Zones

Military Tunnels has relatively low radiation compared to other monuments:

- **Surface area**: Very minimal radiation (0-2 rads)
- **Main tunnels**: Low radiation (2-5 rads)
- **Lower tunnels**: Moderate radiation in some sections (5-10 rads)

Most players can explore with just a hazmat suit or basic radiation protection clothing.

## Detailed Monument Layout

Understanding the layout is crucial for navigating efficiently:

### Surface Level
- **Main Entrance**: Large opening in the mountain with a road leading in
- **Ventilation Towers**: Multiple vertical shafts that provide alternative entrances
- **Loading Dock**: Area with shipping containers and basic loot

### Upper Tunnels
- **Administration Area**: Contains offices and the green keycard room
- **Barracks**: Contains regular loot and scientist spawns
- **Mess Hall**: Area with tables and food crates

### Lower Tunnels
- **Research Labs**: Contains the blue keycard door and scientific equipment
- **Storage Area**: Contains military crates and resources
- **Elite Loot Room**: Final destination after solving the puzzle

### Special Areas
- **Recycler Room**: Contains a recycler for processing components
- **Generator Room**: Contains the fusebox for the puzzle
- **Water Treatment Section**: Flooded area with some loot

## Scientist Locations

Scientists in Military Tunnels follow patrol patterns:

- **Entrance Guards**: 2-3 scientists near the main entrance
- **Tunnel Patrols**: Groups of 1-2 scientists walking predetermined routes
- **Static Guards**: Scientists standing guard at key locations like the blue card room
- **Elite Room Guards**: 2-3 scientists guarding the final loot room

## Puzzle Solution (Detailed Steps)

For beginners, here's a comprehensive guide to completing the card puzzle:

1. **Find the Green Card Room**: From the main entrance, follow the main tunnel until you reach a room with computers and a green keycard door
2. **Access Green Room**: Use your green keycard on the reader and enter before the door closes
3. **Locate the Blue Keycard**: Inside the green room, find the blue keycard typically on a desk or filing cabinet
4. **Find the Generator Room**: Continue deeper into the tunnels to find a room with a large generator
5. **Insert Fuse**: Place a fuse in the fusebox in the generator room and activate it
6. **Find the Blue Card Door**: Continue down the tunnels to find the blue keycard door (typically in the lower level)
7. **Access Blue Room**: Use your blue keycard to open the door (you have limited time before the power expires)
8. **Enter the Elite Loot Room**: Once through the blue door, you'll find the elite crate room with high-tier loot

The entire puzzle must be completed within about 2-3 minutes before fuses expire.

## Loot Locations (Detailed)

For new players looking to maximize their loot runs:

### Administration Area
- **Offices**: Regular crates containing components and occasional weapons
- **Green Card Room**: Military crate and tool boxes

### Barracks Area
- **Sleeping Quarters**: Regular crates with clothing and basic components
- **Armory Lockers**: Military crates with weapons and ammunition

### Research Labs
- **Lab Rooms**: Regular crates with components and medical supplies
- **Secure Storage**: Military crates behind the blue card door

### Elite Loot Room
- **Final Room**: 2-3 elite crates, military crates, and sometimes an airdrop crate
- **Side Storage**: Additional military crates in adjacent rooms

## Common Threats and Dangers

Beyond scientists, be aware of:

1. **Other Players**: Military Tunnels is popular for its loot-to-danger ratio
2. **Disorientation**: The tunnel layout can be confusing for new players
3. **Ambushes**: The many corners and dark areas are perfect for player ambushes
4. **Limited Exits**: Knowing escape routes is crucial when confronted
5. **Time Pressure**: The puzzle requires quick movement once started

## Looting Strategies for Beginners

### Solo Strategy
1. **Stealth Approach**: Move slowly, take out scientists one by one with silenced weapons
2. **Quick In-and-Out**: Focus only on the puzzle and elite room, ignore other loot
3. **Perimeter Looting**: Just loot the surface and entrance areas for safer returns

### Group Strategy (2-3 Players)
1. **Cover Formation**: One player watches while others loot or handle the puzzle
2. **Divide and Conquer**: Split up to handle different sections simultaneously
3. **Relay System**: Pass keycards and fuses to the player moving toward the elite room

## Tips & Tricks for New Players

- **Sound Awareness**: Listen carefully - footsteps echo in the tunnels
- **Map Learning**: Draw or memorize the layout after each visit
- **Scientist Patterns**: Learn where scientists spawn and their patrol routes
- **Weapon Choice**: Silenced weapons are crucial to avoid attracting attention
- **Light Discipline**: Turn your flashlight off when not needed to avoid detection
- **Emergency Exit**: Remember the ventilation shafts for quick escapes
- **Recycler Usage**: The recycler inside is relatively safe compared to other monuments
- **Staging Loot**: Consider temporarily stashing valuable loot outside before making the final exit

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Underestimating Scientists**: They can be deadly in groups, especially in confined spaces
- **Running Out of Ammo**: Bring more than you think you'll need
- **Forgetting Fuses**: Always bring multiple fuses in case one breaks
- **Getting Lost**: Pay attention to landmarks and signs within the tunnels
- **Lingering Too Long**: The longer you stay, the more likely other players will arrive

## Alternative Entry Methods

Besides the main entrance, consider:

1. **Ventilation Shafts**: Vertical access points scattered around the monument
2. **Side Tunnels**: Less obvious entrances with fewer scientists
3. **Water Access**: Some sections can be accessed through partially flooded tunnels

Military Tunnels is an excellent "stepping stone" monument for new players looking to progress beyond basic monuments but not yet ready for high-risk areas like Launch Site. Master it, and you'll develop skills applicable to all of Rust's more challenging locations.
