## Requirements

To fully explore the Military Tunnels, you will need:
- Green keycard

## Layout

The Military Tunnels monument consists of multiple underground tunnels with several key areas:
- Main entrance with the green keycard door
- Blue keycard room
- Scientist-patrolled corridors
- Loot room with crates
- Recycler room
- Multiple surface exits

## Puzzle Solution

1. Enter the main tunnel entrance
2. Find the green keycard room and use your green keycard
3. Inside, collect the blue keycard from the scientist desk
4. Find the blue door deeper in the tunnels
5. Use the blue keycard and insert a fuse into the fusebox
6. Enter the now unlocked loot room quickly before the timer expires
7. Collect loot from elite and military crates

## Tips & Tricks

- Scientists in the tunnels respawn frequently, so clear them quickly
- There are multiple entrances/exits - memorize them for quick escapes
- The recycler inside is relatively safe to use compared to other monuments
- Bring meds and food as combat with scientists can deplete your resources
- Consider bringing a friend as the scientists can sometimes overwhelm solo players
