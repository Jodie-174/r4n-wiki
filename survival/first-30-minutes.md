## Overview

The first half hour in Rust is the most vulnerable and crucial period of your entire wipe. As a new player, your decisions during these initial minutes will determine whether you establish yourself or face repeated deaths. This expanded guide will walk you through every step of your early journey.

## Understanding the Spawn System

When you first join a server:

- You spawn on a random beach location with only a rock and torch
- Each server has different spawn areas, typically along the coastline
- Your first spawn is random, but subsequent spawns will be at your sleeping bag if placed
- Day/night cycles last about 45 minutes total, with 30 minutes of daylight and 15 minutes of darkness
- Weather conditions can affect visibility and survival (rain causes wetness which lowers temperature)

## Immediate Priorities (First 2 Minutes)

The moment you spawn:

1. **Stay calm and assess**: Press G to open your map and note your location
2. **Equip your rock**: Press 1 to equip your starting rock
3. **Find cover**: Move away from the beach into trees or behind rocks
4. **Check surroundings**: Look for aggressive players, monuments, or animals

## Understanding Hunger and Thirst (Minutes 2-5)

The bottom right of your screen shows vital stats:

- **Health**: Plus sign (100 maximum)
- **Hunger**: Cutlery sign (500 maximum)
- **Thirst**: Glass of water sign (250 maximum)
- **Temperature**: Thermometer sign (Above ~3 degrees celcius / 39° Fahrenheit is good, below can cause damage)

When starting:
- Food is your priority over water (hunger depletes faster)
- Picking food (pumpkins, corn, berries) is safer than hunting
- Drinking from rivers/lakes is possible, drinking from the ocean isn't.

## Initial Gathering (Minutes 5-10)

During your first few minutes:

1. **Wood gathering**:
   - Hit trees with your rock (aim for the "X" that appears for faster gathering)
   - Each tree gives approximately 100-200 wood
   - Gather at least 1,000-1,500 wood minimum

2. **Stone gathering**:
   - Hit small and large rocks (grey/brown nodes)
   - Aim for the "sparkle" that appears for faster gathering
   - Gather at least 500-700 stone

3. **Cloth gathering**:
   - Pick hemp plants (green plants with white tops)
   - Each plant gives 10-20 cloth
   - Gather minimum 50-100 cloth for a sleeping bag

4. **Food gathering**:
   - Pick mushrooms around trees (5 food each)
   - Look for pumpkins/corn in fields (15-20 food each)
   - Break red barrels for occasional food cans
   - Hunt animals only if you have a weapon (bow/spear)

## Crafting Your First Tools (Minutes 10-15)

Essential first tools in order of priority:

1. **Stone Hatchet** (200 wood, 100 stone)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Tools > Stone Hatchet
   - Purpose: 2x faster wood gathering than rock
   - Pressing Q while holding it shows crafting options

2. **Stone Pickaxe** (200 wood, 100 stone)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Tools > Stone Pickaxe
   - Purpose: 2x faster stone/metal/sulfur gathering than rock

3. **Wooden Spear** (300 wood)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Weapons > Wooden Spear
   - Purpose: Basic defense against players and animals

4. **Bow and Arrows** (200 wood, 50 cloth for bow, 25 wood + 10 stone per arrow)
   - Access: Press Tab > Crafting > Weapons > Hunting Bow
   - Purpose: Ranged combat and hunting

## Finding a Base Location (Minutes 15-20)

When choosing your first base location:

### Good Locations (for beginners):
- **Near forest and nodes**: For easy resource gathering
- **Near small monuments**: Like Supermarket or Gas Station (not Launch Site or Military Tunnels)
- **Away from large bases**: Avoid established clan territories
- **Off main roads**: To reduce traffic near your base
- **Near freshwater**: Rivers/lakes for hydration

### Poor Locations (avoid as a beginner):
- **On beaches**: Too visible and high traffic
- **Near Tier 2/3 monuments**: High player activity and geared players
- **In open fields**: No natural cover or resources
- **Snowy areas**: Temperature management is difficult
- **Desert areas**: Limited resources and high visibility

## Building Your First Base (Minutes 20-30)

### Starter Base Essentials:

1. **Craft Building Plan and Hammer**:
   - Building Plan (100 wood)
   - Hammer (100 wood)

2. **Key Base Components**:
   - **Tool Cupboard (TC)**: 1,000 wood (prevents others from building nearby, place first!)
   - **Door**: 300 wood
   - **Key Lock**: 100 wood (secure and doesn't require key if solo)
   - **Sleeping Bag**: 30 cloth (your respawn point)
   - **Small Stash**: 30 cloth (hidden storage)
   - **Small Box**: 100 wood (basic storage)
   - **Campfire**: 100 wood (cooking and warmth)

3. **Simple 2x1 Layout**:
   - Place TC in corner (authorize by pressing E)
   - Build airlock entrance (two doors for security)
   - Place sleeping bag away from door
   - Place boxes in corner opposite TC
   - Upgrade walls to stone as soon as possible

### Building Instructions:
1. Equip building plan (press 3)
2. Right-click to select building piece (start with foundation)
3. Left-click to place
4. Use hammer to upgrade (wood → stone is crucial)
5. Place TC and authorize immediately
6. Build walls, doorway, door, and ceiling
7. Add key lock to door (press E on door > Add Lock)
8. Place sleeping bag (this is your respawn point!)

## Immediate Next Steps

After establishing a starter base:

1. **Craft a Furnace** (50 low grade fuel, 1000 stone, 150 wood)
2. **Create a Research Bench** (75 scrap, 500 wood)
3. **Collect scrap from barrels and crates**
4. **Research essential items** (code lock, sheet metal door)
5. **Upgrade tools** (from stone to metal)

## Vital Combat Tips for Beginners

When encountering other players during your first 30 minutes:

1. **Avoidance is key**: If you see a player, crouch (press Ctrl) and hide
2. **Use terrain**: Stay near trees and rocks for quick cover
3. **Listen carefully**: Footsteps give away player positions
4. **Run zigzag**: If being shot at, never run in a straight line
5. **Don't get discouraged**: Death is common in Rust, even for experienced players

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building too big**: A small, finished base is better than a large, incomplete one
2. **Keeping everything in one box**: Spread loot in case of raids
3. **Trusting strangers**: Most players will kill you for your rock
4. **Making too much noise**: Hitting barrels/trees attracts attention
5. **Forgetting to lock doors**: Always verify your door is locked
6. **Building in high-traffic areas**: Visibility equals vulnerability

## Communication Basics

- **Voice chat**: Press V to talk (use sparingly and quietly)
- **Text chat**: Press T to type in chat
- **Hand gestures**: Press and hold B for gestures (waving can sometimes prevent being killed)

## Advanced Tips for Quick Starts

1. **Fishing Village Base**: Building near fishing villages allows for safe recycling
2. **Compound Bow Strategy**: Craft a compound bow early for ambushing better-equipped players
3. **Night Farming**: Use darkness to gather resources more safely
4. **Barrel Roads**: Follow roads for fast component gathering
5. **Beginner Eco Raid**: Use spears to break wooden doors if desperate

## Server Selection for New Players

If you haven't chosen a server yet:

- **Low population**: Servers with 50-100 players are ideal for learning
- **Weekly wipe**: Gives you time to establish yourself
- **Smaller map size**: Increases encounter frequency but reduces running time
- **Solo/Duo/Trio**: Limits group sizes, better for new players
- **PvE or Beginner-friendly**: Some servers have reduced PvP for learning

Remember, your first 30 minutes determine the trajectory of your entire wipe. Stay calm, focus on fundamentals, and don't get discouraged by initial deaths. Rust has a steep learning curve, but the satisfaction of establishing yourself makes it worthwhile!
