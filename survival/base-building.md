## Overview

Your base is your most important asset in Rust - it protects your resources, provides a respawn point, and serves as your crafting hub. This guide will help new players understand the fundamentals of building a secure starter base.

## Base Location Essentials

Choosing the right location is critical for your survival:

- **Proximity to Resources**: Build near nodes for easy farming
- **Monument Distance**: Close enough for scrap runs, far enough to avoid heavy traffic
- **Terrain Advantages**: Use rocks, cliffs, or dense forests for natural protection
- **Avoid Main Roads**: High-traffic areas increase raid risk
- **Building Restricted Zones**: Some areas don't allow building (marked red on map)

**New Player Tip**: The snow biome often has fewer players but harsher survival conditions. Desert has more visibility but less wood.

## Building Materials and Progression

Bases progress through these material tiers:

1. **Twig**: Extremely weak, anyone can destroy/modify
2. **Wood**: Vulnerable to fire, provides minimal security
3. **Stone**: Standard base material, resistant to melee tools
4. **Sheet Metal**: Stronger than stone, weak to explosives
5. **Armored**: Strongest tier, expensive to upgrade

**Important**: Always upgrade from twig immediately - twig structures can be destroyed by anyone.

## Your First Starter Base

A simple 2x1 or 2x2 design is perfect for beginners:

### Building Steps:

1. Gather ~2,000-3,000 wood for a basic structure
2. Place a Tool Cupboard (TC) first and authorize yourself
3. Create a square foundation (or 2x1 rectangle)
4. Place walls and doorways
5. Add a ceiling
6. Upgrade everything to at least wood (stone if possible)
7. Add a wooden door with key lock (or code lock if you have metal)
8. Place a sleeping bag inside

### Essential Base Components:

- **Tool Cupboard (TC)**: Prevents unauthorized building nearby, place in most secure spot
- **Sleeping Bag**: Your spawn point after death
- **Doors**: Always face doors to open inward (more secure)
- **Storage**: Start with small boxes, upgrade to large when possible
- **Airlock**: Two doors creating a buffer zone (prevents door camping)

## Building a Secure Airlock

An airlock is crucial for preventing deep losses when entering/exiting:

1. Create a small entrance room with two doors
2. Ensure the doors swing in opposite directions
3. Only open one door at a time

## Key Security Features

Even for a starter base, consider these security enhancements:

- **Honeycomb**: Extra layers of walls around your main structure
- **Multiple TCs**: For larger bases, consider multiple cupboards
- **Bunker Entrances**: Advanced technique using temporary twig to access
- **Roof Access**: Consider adding a shooting floor or watch tower
- **External TCs**: Small external bases with TCs to prevent building up

## Base Building Tips for New Players

1. **Start Small**: Don't build bigger than you can upgrade
2. **Hide Your TC**: Place it in the least obvious/accessible spot
3. **Multiple Doors**: Each door is another layer of security
4. **Lock Everything**: Even airlock internal doors should be locked
5. **Spread Loot**: Don't keep all valuables in one place
6. **Metal Doors ASAP**: Upgrade wooden doors quickly
7. **Build in Stages**: Secure a small core first, then expand
8. **Backups Matter**: Create stashes or small backup bases

## Common Base Building Mistakes

- Building too big before securing core
- Using weak doors with strong walls
- Obvious TC placement
- No airlock
- Building in high-traffic areas
- Not upgrading beyond twig or wood
- Storing all loot in one room
- Forgetting to lock doors

Remember, no base is completely raid-proof. The goal is to make your base cost more to raid than what raiders will get from it.
